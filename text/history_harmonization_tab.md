#### Instruction

Here keeps track of the variables already harmonized in the history of NEAR projects. It does not specify the variables' waves or categories but provides an overall landscape.

The goal is to facilitate early metadata collection when starting a new project.

Each database will have an example variable name for each measure/project. Please note that the variable name is the same as what we practically used in related projects instead of names on Maelstrom (except for simul-age). 

Format Rule:

* For one project, if a database is not included, the cell is "**NA**". If a database is included but one variable is not available, then the cell is "**\__BLANK\__**".

Reference:
1. R harmonization script;
2. Master file, harmo rule files and data schema in past projects:
    * Project nr.01: Health assessment tool, HAT (Xiaonan, Bolin)
    * Project nr.03: Physical function before death (Bolin)
    * Project nr.07: Medications effects on trajectories of biological age (Bolin)
    * Project nr.08: Simul-age (Farid, Debora)
    * Project nr.12: Cohort differences in Sweden (Debora, Bolin)
    * Project nr.17: BMI-Mortality (Bolin)
    
Reference files are available in the corresponding project folder.

Don't hesitate to get in touch with Bolin if you have any question.
