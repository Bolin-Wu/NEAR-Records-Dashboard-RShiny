#### Hej!

Welcome! This web app is designed to complement the information provided by Maelstrom's metadata and databases' codebooks. Drawing from our extensive project experience, we've curated and continually update this resource to facilitate faster data request handling and harmonization for internal NEAR central members.

We value your feedback and inquiries. Please don't hesitate to reach out to the maintainer, Bolin Wu: bolin.wu@ki.se, with any suggestions or questions.
